What you need to understand before reading this article is that the content of this article is only a personal opinion, and I am not the main maintainer and contributor of TypeScript, nor have I invited the authoritative person of TypeScript to review it, so I cannot guarantee the complete correctness of this article. But I have repeatedly revised the content of this article to try to ensure its accuracy. When you find any technical errors or controversial ideologies, please raise them in the comment area. I will update the content in time to avoid misleading others.",
